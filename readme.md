## 02. Exploring React Native Navigation

### Overview
This challenge deepens my understanding of `Navigation` functions of `React Native Navigation` version 3.x. Creating tabs using `creareStackNavigator`, `createSwitchNavigator`, `createBottomTabNavigator`, `createAppContainer`, and `createDrawerNavigator` are some of the few things I was exploring in this project.
