### Overview :sunglasses:

I wanted to make an application that renders [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) so I made this application that renders maps on a mobile device. I had so much fun building this application and I learned how to render map components using `MapView` and the properties that are needed for the map to render. I also learned how to create map markers using `MapView.Marker` and animate the markers when a new location is selected. I also learned how to `Polygons` and `Polylines`. This can be very useful for projects that needs map components.

<summary><strong>03. Animations of React Native</strong></summary>

### Overview :sunglasses:
I was playing with `React Native Animation` library for this project and I learned a lot from it. In this project I learned configure animation using `Animate.timing()` and how to compose animation methods. I also explored how to combine animations values and how to modify the segments of the animation using `interpolate()` and use it to built in methods like `transform`, `translate`, `scale`.

<summary><strong>02. Exploring React Native Navigation</strong></summary>

### Overview :sunglasses:
This challenge deepens my understanding of `Navigation` functions of [React Native Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) version 3.x. Creating tabs using `creareStackNavigator`, `createSwitchNavigator`, `createBottomTabNavigator`, `createAppContainer`, and `createDrawerNavigator` are some of the few things I was exploring in this project.

### Overview :sunglasses:
This is a full [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) project I took from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-the-practical-guide/learn/lecture/13914812#content). The course covers a lot of `React Native` fundamentals from `Component` rendering, `Navigation and Routers`, `Animation`, `Styling`, `Redux`, `State and Props` and many more like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). The course also covers other libraries like [Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons), [Camera Detection](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera) and [Geolocations](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/geolocation). I have learned a lot in this course and it has broaden my knowledge about this framework.
