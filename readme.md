> Libraries Used:
  * [React Native Camera](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera)
  * [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

  * [React Native Networking](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network). 



## Installation

Create a new application with
```bash
$ react-native init project-name
```

cd to your project-name and install the following external libraries in your project;

```bash
$ npm install react-native-camera
$ npm install firebase
$ npm install react-redux
```
After installation, check the documentation for [React Native Camera](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera) on how to set-up the camera in your code stack. You can just follow the guide for set-up. You also need to set up a back end for your data storage. With this, you need [Google Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and you can read the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/) in this link on how to set up your back end.
