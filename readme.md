<summary><strong>06. Barcode Scanner</strong></summary>

### Overview :sunglasses:

Barcode scanners are one of the applications that amazes me. So, I have decided to create one. This is app allows you to scan barcodes directly from the user's browser. The app is using [Quagga](https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/) a javascript library that streams the user's camera and then searches for any barcodes rendered from the streamed video. The app fetches data from [Barcode API](https://www.barcodelookup.com/api) and then returns product information related to the barcode.

<summary><strong>05. Camera of React Native </strong></summary>

### Overview :sunglasses:

I was trying to play some api's where I can render a real camera with [React Native Camera](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera) and store images to cloud storage using [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and store all images data so that the user can access all the information. I was very excited creating this app. In this project, I learned how to set up a native app using camera and how to build a cloud data storage.

<summary><strong>04. Maps of React Native </strong></summary>

### Overview :sunglasses:

[View project source code](https://github.com/Aimanski12/MyReactNativeProjects/tree/proj04).

I wanted to make an application that renders [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) so I made this application that renders maps on a mobile device. I had so much fun building this application and I learned how to render map components using `MapView` and the properties that are needed for the map to render. I also learned how to create map markers using `MapView.Marker` and animate the markers when a new location is selected. I also learned how to `Polygons` and `Polylines`. This can be very useful for projects that needs map components.

<summary><strong>03. Animations of React Native</strong></summary>

### Overview :sunglasses:
I was playing with `React Native Animation` library for this project and I learned a lot from it. In this project I learned configure animation using `Animate.timing()` and how to compose animation methods. I also explored how to combine animations values and how to modify the segments of the animation using `interpolate()` and use it to built in methods like `transform`, `translate`, `scale`.

<summary><strong>02. Exploring React Native Navigation</strong></summary>

### Overview :sunglasses:
This challenge deepens my understanding of `Navigation` functions of [React Native Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) version 3.x. Creating tabs using `creareStackNavigator`, `createSwitchNavigator`, `createBottomTabNavigator`, `createAppContainer`, and `createDrawerNavigator` are some of the few things I was exploring in this project.

<summary><strong>01. Photo Sharing App @ Udemy</strong></summary>

### Overview :sunglasses:
This is a full [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) project I took from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-the-practical-guide/learn/lecture/13914812#content). The course covers a lot of `React Native` fundamentals from `Component` rendering, `Navigation and Routers`, `Animation`, `Styling`, `Redux`, `State and Props` and many more like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). The course also covers other libraries like [Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons), [Camera Detection](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera) and [Geolocations](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/geolocation). I have learned a lot in this course and it has broaden my knowledge about this framework.
