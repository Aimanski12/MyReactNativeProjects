## Currency Converter

> From the last project, I added a [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) and integrated a currency calculator app for this project. Thank you for looking into this repo. All the data from this app are taken from [API Frankfurter](https://www.frankfurter.app/) and [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.eu/).

  * How to use [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/).
  * How to reuse components to minimize writting codes.
  * How to efficiently organize and manage data structures. 
  * How to query data from a third party library using `axios` with the `async` and `await` promise.
  * How to pass states aroun the application without any redux.
