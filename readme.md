# Barcode Scanner 

> This is app allows you to scan barcodes directly from the user's browser. The app is using [Quagga](https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/) a javascript library that streams the user's camera and then searches for any barcodes rendered from the streamed video. The app fetches data from [Barcode API](https://www.barcodelookup.com/api) and then returns product information related to the barcode. 

[View it from your browser](https://aimanski-react06-barcodescan.firebaseapp.com/). Deployed at firebase.
