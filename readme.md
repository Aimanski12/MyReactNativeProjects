> Animations are one of the important things that bring more life to your website. So I have decided to create this app with some animations. I am using [React Reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/) a lightweight react animation library.

> Things I learned in this project;
  * How to use animation component from a library package.
  * How to trigger events inside the DOM with react events.
  * How to pass state around the application without any redux.
