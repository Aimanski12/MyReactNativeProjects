### Overview
This challenge deepens my understanding of `Navigation` functions of [React Native Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) version 3.x. Creating tabs using `creareStackNavigator`, `createSwitchNavigator`, `createBottomTabNavigator`, `createAppContainer`, and `createDrawerNavigator` are some of the few things I was exploring in this project.

<summary><strong>01. Photo Sharing App @ Udemy</strong></summary>

### Overview
This is a full [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) project I took from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-the-practical-guide/learn/lecture/13914812#content). The course covers a lot of `React Native` fundamentals from `Component` rendering, `Navigation and Routers`, `Animation`, `Styling`, `Redux`, `State and Props` and many more like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). The course also covers other libraries like [Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons), [Camera Detection](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera) and [Geolocations](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/geolocation). I have learned a lot in this course and it has broaden my knowledge about this framework.
