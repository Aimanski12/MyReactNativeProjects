## Gradient and Animation

> In this app I am making a simple TodoList that renders animation using [CSSTransition](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition) and [TransitionGroup](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition-group) library from ReactJS and with diffent background for each list to generate a gradient look list.

  * How to generate different background of an element by generating a sequence of number and placing them in an array.
  * How to use CSSTransition and TransitionGroup of the ReactJS built-in animation library.
  * How to set a element-in and element-out when transitioning an element to create animations.
