# Exploring React Native Navigation

> I built this simple app to explore `React Native Navigation` functions, to understand how to switch from one tab to another, and how to create bottom navigation tabs and navigator stack. Things I learned in this project;
  * How to use `React Native Navigation` library.
  * How to switch navigations and add navigation headers.
  * How to pass state and props from one navigation stack to another.
  * How to use `Icons`.
  * How to use `Native Base` library.
> Libraries used.
  * [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org)
  * [Native Base](https://nativebase.io)
